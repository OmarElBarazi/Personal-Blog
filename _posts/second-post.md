During my free time and breaks from the world of development, I use the opportunity to engage in a diverse range of activities that nourish my mind, and body. These moments of respite serve as essential ingredients in my pursuit of a balanced and fulfilling life.

One of my favorite pastimes is spending quality time with friends. Social connections are valuable, and it is quite amazing the laughter and camaraderie that accompanies shared moments with those who matter. These interactions provide a welcome break from the screen and offer a chance to unwind and relax.

Chess has also become a beloved passion of mine. This ancient game serves as a mental battleground where strategic thinking, foresight, and problem-solving are put to the test. Each move is a calculated step, and every game is a thrilling challenge that enhances my cognitive abilities.

In the realm of literature, I find inspiration in the pages of books that recount the experiences of individuals navigating the complexities of life. Whether it's tales of successful entrepreneurs, explorers, these stories offer valuable insights and broaden my perspective.

Lebanon, particularly my city of Tripoli, holds a special place in my heart. I often seek refuge in the cozy ambiance of its coffee shops. On warm summer days, my go-to refreshment is an iced Americano, foam-free top. But when winter arrives, I savor the comforting warmth of a classic hot mocha. The simple act of sipping on these beverages while contemplating life's intricacies brings a sense of enjoyment.

Exploration is another facet of my life that brings me great joy. I've spent weekends uncovering the hidden treasures of historical Lebanese cities, immersing myself in their past. Hiking trips have allowed me to observe nature, offering moments of serenity and awe as I traverse picturesque landscapes.

One of the most memorable experiences was embarking on a camping adventure with friends. It was quite the entry into the world of camping, and it left an amazing mark on me. Gazing at the star-studded night sky, sharing stories around a crackling campfire, and waking up to the beauty of a sunrise in the great outdoors were experiences that filled me with positive energy and a profound sense of peace.

In the end, these diverse pursuits outside the realm of development serve as a reminder that life contain a lot of activities. They provide the necessary balance and inspiration that fuel my ongoing quest for personal and professional growth. Just as I am dedicated to honing my skills as a developer, I am equally committed to savoring the richness of life's experiences and continuously nurturing my mind.
